Embark on the creation of a scalable and modular Trip Planning API and Client using Python, Flask, jQuery, and Tiny DB. This project focused on developing a robust backend system for user registration, login, and trip proposal functionalities. By prioritizing scalability and modularity, I ensured the systemâ€™s flexibility for future enhancements, allowing it to adapt to new requirements over time.
